# Conservation of Momentum Animations

An interactive educational resource demonstrating the conservation of momentum through animations and explanations for middle school physics students.

## Features

- Interactive animations demonstrating momentum conservation
- Five different physics scenarios:
  - One-dimensional elastic collision
  - One-dimensional inelastic collision
  - Two-dimensional collision
  - Explosion/separation demonstration
  - Rocket propulsion as a real-world example
- Comprehensive explanations with formulas and real-world applications
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive design for use on various devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas for animations

## Live Demo
